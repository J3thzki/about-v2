            <p><strong>The school, founded in 1946,</strong> initially occupied a rented building that was once the residence of the Moreno family. It had 6 rooms, with one serving as the Principal’s Office and Teachers’ Room.
            Adjacent to it were the library and laboratory, separated by a thin sawali partition. The library was far from being conducive to study because it was used as a classroom. What with the crowded space and the noise of the recitations going on, students had no other alternatives but do the studying and reading elsewhere. The other three rooms were classrooms. Like the library and laboratory, they were separated from each other by sawali partitions that served not even to muffle the voices in each class.
            After 5 years, the new building of General de Jesus Academy sprawled on A. Vallarta St. in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija upon its own lot. The building frontage by a new shingle with the Silver Star, Torch, and Book – our pledge to the institution and her trust to us – served as the main features. When formerly the school had six rooms, now she has nine (9). Interesting to all are the laboratory and library. In the former is gathered costly instruments and chemicals, chart, and specimens – the joy of any eager scientist. The library occupying a corner room with windows on both outward sides, literally overflows with maps and charts. Sets of encyclopedias, classical and modern literature, magazines, and newspapers – all these, the delight of any literary enthusiast the library has. And now, the library is in the true sense of a library. It is devoted solely to reading and study.

            GJC recognizes the vital role of the library in fulfilling the educational requirements of the students; hence, it continues to be a part of the online learning community even during the pandemic. With the resuming of face-face learning, the library will continue to serve its clientele with a hyflex (hybrid-flexible) learning. This is a combination of onsite and offsite access to available library resources.
